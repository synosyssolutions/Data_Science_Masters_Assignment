Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.

Ans: A database is an organized collection of data stored in a computer system and usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

SQL                                                         NoSQL
data stored in form of table                       data stored in form of documents
fixed schema                                       dynamic schema
not suitable for hierarchical data storage         best suited for hierarchical data storage
vertically scalable                                horizontally scalable
eg:- Oracle, MS-SQL,MySQl....                      eg:- MongoDB,HBase,Cassandra....

Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.

Ans: Data Definition Language is used to define the database structure or schema. DDL command in sql
is also used to specify additional properties of the data. The storage structure and access methods used by the database system by a set of statements in a special type of DDL called a data storage and definition language.

CREATE : to create objects in database
eg:- create table department
     (dept_name  char(20),
      building   char(15),
      budget     numeric(12,2));
      
ALTER : alters the structure of database
eg:- alter table department
     (dept_name  char(20),
      building   char(15),
      wing       char(5)
      budget     numeric(12,2));
DROP : delete objects from database
eg:- drop object_name
TRUNCATE : drops the database and recreate with same schema
eg:- TRUNCATE object_name

Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.

Ans:- DML stands for Data Manipulation Language.DML is a way to inform a database precisely what we want it to do by conversing in a manner that it has been built to comprehend from scratch. When it comes to interacting with existing data, whether adding, moving, or deleting data, it provides a convenient way to do so.

Insert: Insert record into table
eg:- Insert into [database].[table_name] values (val1,val2,val3,.....)

Update: Update existing record into table
eg:- update [table_name] set [column_name] = value where [condition]

Delete: Deletes record from table
eg:- DELETE FROM [table_name] WHERE [some_condition];

Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.

Ans: DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it.

SELECT ==> It is used to retrieve data from the database
eg:- SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name<br>WHERE condition;

Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.

Ans:- Primary keys and foreign keys are fundamental components of relational database theory. They are used to ensure data integrity and maintain data consistency.

PRIMARY KEY	                                                                                              FOREIGN KEY
*A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique.	                  * A foreign key is a column or                                                                                                group of columns in a relational                                                                                            database table that provides a                                                                                              link between data in two tables.
*It uniquely identifies a record in the relational database table.	                      * It refers to the field in a                                                                                                 table which is the primary key                                                                                                of another table.

Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.

Ans:- 
import mysql.connector
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="abc",
  password="password"
)
print(mydb)
mycursor = mydb.cursor()
mycursor.execute("select * from test1.test_table")
for i in mycursor.fetchall():
    print(i)
    
    
cursor() ==> is used to execute statements to communicate with the MySQL database.
             Using the methods of it you can execute SQL statements, fetch data from the result sets, call procedures.
             
execute() ==> It is one of the method of cursor that accepts MySQL query as parameter and executes it.


Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.
